<!--  HI! Welcome to opening an issue for node SerialPort. We're very happy to answer questions, give advise and take suggestions.

A few things first. Did you notice the README? We have lots of information about how to use SerialPort with electron, the raspberry pi, and other platforms. So if you need help with installation or runtime errors please see

Secondly if you're having trouble with the API, did you check that you're looking at the right version of the docs? The API has changed over the years. The latest is in the readme. You can find links to all the versions there too.
